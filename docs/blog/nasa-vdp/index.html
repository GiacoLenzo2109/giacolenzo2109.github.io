Unlike traditional bug bounties, the reward is purely ethical hacking glory – but with a cosmic twist.\nFor valid P3 or higher vulnerabilities, researchers receive:\n📜 A personalized Letter of Acknowledgment ✨ Public listing in NASA’s Hall of Fame 👾 Challenge accepted 👾\nVulnerability Hunting Domain Recon While developing an automated domain reconnaissance tool, I needed a worthy target to test its capabilities. NASA’s Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP), with its vast constellation of subdomains and complex infrastructure, seemed like the perfect challenge.\nAfter scanning and cataloging hundreds of potential targets, I began hunting for particularly interesting subdomains.\nSelf-Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) My initial discoveries were underwhelming, a few self-XSS flaws (automatically classified as P5) that didn’t qualify for recognition, along with several P3 duplicates that had already been reported. The hunt was proving tougher than expected.\nThen came the breakthrough during one of those late-night hacking sessions I stumbled upon an intriguing subdomain hosting a web application protected by a login portal.\nHere’s what made the vulnerability interesting:\nRegistration was open to all users.\nVarious post-login functionalities were available.\nUser input was not properly sanitized.\nWhile navigating the website as an authenticated user, I began testing various functionalities until I discovered the ability to store a custom configuration tied to the current application. This configuration is automatically loaded upon each user login, and its values are directly reflected within the application’s interface.\nI attempted to insert the following simple XSS payload:\n\u003cimg src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)\u003e The following HTTP POST request was used to save the new configuration.\nI successfully saved the malicious payload persistently in the web application configuration, leading to a successful XSS attack!\nUnfortunately, it was classified as a Self-Stored XSS (P5) since it was limited to my own account. According to the BugCrowd taxonomy, it was deemed an Informational Vulnerability.\nSession Fixation Since the Self-Stored XSS was classified as P5 and the only way to persist it across different users was by hijacking the session (Session Hijacking), I noticed that no cookies were used. Instead, the sessionid was passed in the body of the request.\nThis prompted me to analyze the authentication flow, eager to understand how the sessionid was generated and utilized by the application. During my investigation, I uncovered a more critical flaw: it is possible to retrieve a sessionid from the server and set it before logging in. Once the login is completed, the sessionid remains unchanged and is not invalidated.\nAn attacker could exploit this token to perform various requests as the victim.\nAuthentication Flow Login Initiator: The login process to the web application begins with an HTTP POST request to obtain a valid sessionid from the server, which is then directly included in the response. Request Login Form: A POST request is made, containing the information obtained from the Login Initiator in the request body. The response returns an HTML page with a login form, where hidden input fields are pre-populated with values from the body (such as the sessionid and host). Here an example of the form generated using the sessionid passed in the previous request:\n\u003cform action='https://.nasa.gov//LoginSubmit' name='loginform' method='post'\u003e \u003cfieldset\u003e \u003cinput type='hidden' id='loginid' name='loginid' value=ID /\u003e \u003cinput type='hidden' id='sessionid' name='sessionid' value=ID /\u003e \u003cinput type='hidden' name='host' value='HOST' /\u003e \u003cinput type='hidden' name='loginpath' value='LOGIN_PATH' /\u003e \u003cdiv class='ffield'\u003e \u003clabel for='uid'\u003eUser ID:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/label\u003e \u003cinput type='text' id='uid' name='uid' size=25 /\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003clabel for='pwd'\u003ePassword:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/label\u003e \u003cinput type='password' id='pwd' name='pwd' size=25 /\u003e \u003ca href='#' onmousedown='toggleDiv()'\u003eForgot your password?\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/p\u003e \u003cSNIPPET\u003e \u003c/fieldset\u003e \u003c/form\u003e Login Monitor: An HTTP POST request is made to monitor for a successful login. Once the user is logged in, this request returns the user’s information, such as username and email. Login Submit: Once the login is completed, the sessionid retrieved during the Login Initiator phase and the username obtained during the Login Monitor phase are used to execute various requests within the web application. In this way, an attacker could exploit the session fixation vulnerability to force the victim to use a known sessionid, effectively impersonating the victim.\nThis finding hit P3 status, which meant one beautiful thing:\n“I’m eligable for NASA acknowledgment letter!”\nExploit Chain Analysis As I stared at these two seemingly isolated findings, a dangerous possibility emerged:\n“What if I could combine the session fixation flaw with this persistent Self-Stored XSS? Could these P3 and P5 vulnerabilities somehow create a greater-level threat?”\nAll the pieces aligned:\n✅ Session id persisted post-authentication\n✅ XSS request using sessionid\n✅ No anti-CSRF token protection\nThe potential attack vector became clear:\nSession Fixation + CSRF: Force a victim to login with a known sessionid Self-Stored XSS: Store and trigger the stored XSS payload using the victim’s sessionid Proof of Concept 1. Create a Python server (Attacker Proxy Server) A custom Python-based proxy server was developed to intercept and initiate the Login Initiator request in order to capture the sessionid and host that would later be used by the victim. Additionally, the proxy was used to monitor login activity and extract the authenticated user’s details (e.g. username), which were essential to successfully perform a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. Once the username was obtained, the Stored XSS request was executed, ensuring that it would be triggered automatically upon the victim’s next login to the web application.\nLogin Initiator: Execute the Login Initiator request and return the generated sessionid (loginid) to the victim.\nLogin Monitor: Perform Login Monitor to capture the authenticated user’s information (e.g., username) required for the XSS malicious request.\nStore XSS: Inject a stored XSS payload into the victim’s web application configuration using the collected sessionid (loginid) and username.\nfrom flask import Flask, request, jsonify, redirect import requests from flask_cors import CORS from xml.etree import ElementTree as ET from threading import Thread app = Flask(__name__) CORS(app) # 1.

Retry later!\") return except requests.RequestException as e: return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500 if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8080, debug=True) 2. Create a PoC HTML file This chain will only be effective in a phishing attack scenario. A PoC HTML file was created to combine Session Fixation with CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).\nLogin Initiator: When the victim opens the PoC HTML file, a JavaScript payload is executed which triggers a fetch request to the attacker-controlled proxy server. The proxy then issues an HTTP POST request to the Login Initiator endpoint (https://.nasa.gov//LoginInitiator) to obtain a new sessionid, which will later be associated with the victim’s session.\nLogin Form: Due to the way the login flow is implemented, the login form is dynamically generated through an HTTP POST request to https://.nasa.gov//LoginForm. This request includes the previously obtained sessionid and host in the body, which are then embedded as hidden input fields in the returned form. As a result, when the victim submits their credentials, the same sessionid becomes associated with their authenticated session.\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e \u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e \u003chead\u003e \u003cmeta charset=\"UTF-8\"\u003e \u003cmeta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"\u003e \u003ctitle\u003eSession Fixation + Stored XSS\u003c/title\u003e \u003c/head\u003e \u003cbody\u003e \u003cscript\u003e // 1.

PoC Now that both the exploit and the proxy server were ready, I simulated a phishing attack by delivering the PoC HTML file to the victim (for simplicity, I used my own user giacolenzo2109).\nThe image below shows the output of the Python proxy server, highlighting each step of the attack flow that was successfully executed.\nIt is possible to observe how the server successfully obtained the sessionid used by the victim to login, and how the XSS was ultimately stored on the victim’s account.\n4. XSS Finally, the stored XSS payload was successfully triggered upon the victim’s first login.\nReward From a P5 Stored XSS (Charmander) to a P2 Session Fixation chained with Self-Stored XSS, significantly increasing the impact (Charizard).\nLesson Learned Security weaknesses should always be viewed as part of a broader attack surface. By chaining vulnerabilities together, we can better assess their full risk and potential impact.\nVulnerability Impact Self-Stored XSS (Charmander) P5 Session Fixation (Charmeleon) P3 Session Fixation + CSRF + Self-Stored XSS (Charizard) P2 Letter of Acknowledgement ","wordCount":"1807","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/images/articles/nasa-vdp/nasa.png","datePublished":"2025-05-13T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-05-13T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"GiacoLenzo2109"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/blog/nasa-vdp/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Giacomo Lenzini","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Giacomo Lenzini (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Giacomo Lenzini</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

Create a PoC HTML file<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-create-a-poc-html-file>#</a></h3><p>This chain will only be effective in a phishing attack scenario. A PoC HTML file was created to combine <em>Session Fixation</em> with <em>CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)</em>.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Login Initiator</strong>: When the victim opens the PoC HTML file, a JavaScript payload is executed which triggers a fetch request to the attacker-controlled proxy server. The proxy then issues an HTTP POST request to the Login Initiator endpoint (<code>https://&lt;REDACTED>.nasa.gov/&lt;REDACTED>/LoginInitiator</code>) to obtain a new <em>sessionid</em>, which will later be associated with the victim&rsquo;s session.</p></li><li><p><strong>Login Form</strong>: Due to the way the login flow is implemented, the login form is dynamically generated through an HTTP POST request to <code>https://&lt;REDACTED>.nasa.gov/&lt;REDACTED>/LoginForm</code>. This request includes the previously obtained <em>sessionid</em> and <em>host</em> in the body, which are then embedded as hidden input fields in the returned form. As a result, when the victim submits their credentials, the same <em>sessionid</em> becomes associated with their authenticated session.</p></li></ol><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-html data-lang=html><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=cp>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
