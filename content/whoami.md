In my spare time, I actively participate in **Bug Bounty** programs and engage in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and practice on various vulnerable labs (HackTheBox) to enhance my skills in ethical hacking and red teaming. I am also passionate about sports, having practiced kickboxing for 13 years, including 10 years at a competitive level. Currently, I practice CrossFit to maintain my fitness and discipline.
